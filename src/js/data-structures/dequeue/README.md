# Dequeue

The following is an implementation of a double ended queue or dequeue data stucture. The dequeue data structure is an ordered collection of items that follow the _first in, first out_, or **FIFO** principle. It is very similar to the queue data structure, but the dequeue differs by allowing the queue and dequeue to occur on both sides. The dequeue class will support the following methods:

- addFront()
- addBack()
- removeFront()
- removeBack()
- peekFront() returns the top element of the stack. stack is not modified
- peekBack() returns the top element of the stack. stack is not modified
- isEmpty() returns true if stack does not contain elements
- clear() removes all elements from the stack
- size() returns the number of elements that the stack contains
- toString() converts the items to string, joined by a comma
