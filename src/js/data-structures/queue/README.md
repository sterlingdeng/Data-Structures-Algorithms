# Queue

The following is an implementation of a Queue data stucture. THe Queue data structure is an ordered collection of items that follow the _first in, first out_, or **FIFO** principle. The Queue class will support the following methods:

- queue queues
- dequeue removes the top element from the stack
- peek() returns the top element of the stack. stack is not modified
- isEmpty() returns true if stack does not contain elements
- clear() removes all elements from the stack
- size() returns the number of elements that the stack contains
- toString() converts the items to string, joined by a comma
