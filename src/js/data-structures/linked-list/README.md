# Linked-List Data Structure

Arrays are one of the most basic data structures used in programming. Because arrays are generally of a fixed length and are placed sequentially in memory, any addition to the front, back, or middle of the array will be expensive, since the elements will need to be shifted over to do so (this is done underneath the hood). Because of this, arrays and their methods generally have a time complexity of O(n), where n is the size of the array.

Linked List, on the other hand, is very similar to an array, such that the order of the elements behave like an array, but the elements stored in the linked list are not placed contiguously in memory. Each element consists of a node that stores the element (or data) and also a reference (or pointer) to the next element.
