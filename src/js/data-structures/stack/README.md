# Stack

The following is an implementation of a Stack data stucture using objects, rather than an array. The Stack class will support the following methods:

- push() method adds a new element to the top of the stack
- pop() removes the top element from the stack
- peek() returns the top element of the stack. stack is not modified
- isEmpty() returns true if stack does not contain elements
- clear() removes all elements from the stack
- size() returns the number of elements that the stack contains
- toString() converts the items to string, joined by a comma
